I am a software engineer at Personal Robots group of MIT Media Lab. My long term research endeavor is to build aritificial integlligence (AI) systems that support humans decision making under uncertainty. Currently, my research revolves around `interpretability` and `alignment` of language models in educational settings. 

<!-- It involves designing algorithms to defend models against adversarial inputs, for example, safeguarding large language models (LLMs) from prompts that circumvent safety guardrails. I have studied and contributed to model robustness in several machine learning domains including `computer vision`, `reinforcement learning`, and `language modeling`. My work has been accepted in prominent ML conferences such as `ICML`, `ICLR` and `NeurIPS`, and I am actively involved in collaborative projects within the academic community. -->

**Media Coverage:** My recent works on `LLM robustness` and `reliability` have been featured in major media and academic news outlets:
  1. [Science News Magazine](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/generative-ai-chatbots-chatgpt-safety-concerns?trk=feed_main-feed-card_feed-article-content), [D^3 Institute at Harvard](https://d3.harvard.edu/certifying-llm-safety-against-adversarial-prompting/). Work featured: [Certifying LLM Safety against Adversarial Prompting](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9Ik05cycLq).
  2. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/30/technology/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-manipulation.html). Work featured: [Manipulating Large Language Models to Increase Product Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07981).
  3. [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/turnitin-ai-cheating-detector-accuracy/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-06/biden-ai-executive-order-shows-urgency-of-deepfakes), [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-detection-chat-gpt-college-students/), [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2366824-reliably-detecting-ai-generated-text-is-mathematically-impossible/), [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/21/detecting_ai_generated_text/), [TechSpot](https://www.techspot.com/news/98031-reliable-detection-ai-generated-text-impossible-new-study.html). Work featured: [Can AI-Generated Text be Reliably Detected?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11156).

Before joining Harvard, I completed my PhD at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu) in `certified robustness` in machine learning (see my dissertation [here](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/items/f4ad78d5-f6a8-47cf-bdca-358410186a96)). I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/) and [Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). During my PhD, I have spent time as an applied scientist intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) and a research intern at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/), where I worked on uncertainty estimation for human action recognition models and network security-related machine learning applications. I have also served as a reviewer for machine learning conferences such as ICML, ICLR and NeurIPS.

I did my undergraduate studies at [IIT Mandi](https://iitmandi.ac.in/) and my master's at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), where I studied a wide range of topics in computer science such as machine learning, advanced algorithms, combinatorial optimization, complexity theory and cryptography. My master's thesis was on the computational hardness of approximating the optimal solution of a variant of the k-center clustering problem.
