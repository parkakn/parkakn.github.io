Hi! I'm currently a data scientitst at [MIT Open Learning](https://openlearning.mit.edu/), where I analyze job transitions and career mobility among US workers. I am also working with the Personal Robots Group of MIT Media Lab on developing an educational AI tutor. 

Previously, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Antoinette Schoar at MIT Sloan School of Management and spent time in industry at Giant Oak (now [Saifr](https://saifr.ai/about) of Fidelity Investments) and Brain Asset Management. 

I hold a Master of Science in Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, where I conducted research on identifying regimes in the stock market and forecasting stock returns. Prior to that, I graduated from Boston College in 2021 with dual Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Economics, where my research focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the Fed Funds rate and examining the relationship between the stock market and the business cycle.

Outside of work, I love playing soccer! I played for Citybros FC while in New York, FC Boston during college, and currently play for MIT FC.

### Research Interest
My research interest is on machine learning, statistics, and stochastic processes. Currently, I am focsued on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), advancing the personalization of LLMs, and the application of generative AI in a broad range of fields including social robots, education, finance, and economics.
