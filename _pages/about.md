I am a software engineer at the [Personal Robots Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/) of [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). My long term research endeavor is to build artificial intelligence (AI) systesm that support humans decision making under uncertainty, especially in *education* and *finance*. Currently, my research revolves around `interpretability` and `alignment` of language models (LMs) as modern AI tutors. I study how they behave pedagogically, how their behavior influences student learning, and how different alignment techniques shape those outcomes. I also develop core components of [PyTutor](https://raise.mit.edu/research/research-projects/pytutor/), an AI tutoring platform deployed across multiple universities as part of the [MIT RAISE](https://raise.mit.edu/) initiative. 
<!-- , such as advanced  retrieval for PyTutor’s retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) pipeline and personalized feedback feature based on student’s classroom performance. -->

Before MIT, I completed my Master of Science in Mathematics at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at New York University with a master's thesis on applying machine learning methods to stock return forecasting ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00459)). I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Kenneth Winston](https://math-finance.cims.nyu.edu/team/kenneth-winston/) and to receive additional mentorship from Professor [Jonathan Goodman](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/GOODMAN_Jonathan.html).

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), where I studied a wide range of topics across mathematics, economics, and finance. I was fortunate to receive guidance from Professor [Robert Murphy](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/office-of-university-communications/for-the-media/boston-college-faculty-experts/robert-murphy.html) on my senior honors thesis, which examined how instability in the stock market propagates into the real economy.

<!-- Before joining the MIT Media Lab, I worked as a data scientist at [MIT Open Learning](https://openlearning.mit.edu/), where I modeled job-mobility pathways for a project funded by the [Air Force Research Laboratory](https://www.afrl.af.mil/). I also spent time as a research assistant at the [MIT Sloan School of Management](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) under the guidance of Professor [Antoinette Schoar](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/antoinette-schoar).
