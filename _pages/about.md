I am a software engineer at the [Personal Robots Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/) of [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), where I focus on language model applications for educational tools (e.g. AI tutors). I design and develop system features that support personalized learning pathways for students and evaluate pedagogical effectiveness of language models. 

My broader research objective is to advance our understanding of AI models and mitigate unintended or harmful behaviors, ultimately to provide reliable and personalized support for human decision-making under uncertainty. I am especially interested in high-stakes domains, such as education and financial decision-making, where model failures have real-world consequences. 

In 2023, I graduated from the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at New York University with a Master of Science in Mathematics. Under the mentorship of Professor [Kenneth Winston](https://math-finance.cims.nyu.edu/team/kenneth-winston/) and Professor [Jonathan Goodman](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/GOODMAN_Jonathan.html), I completed a master's thesis on applying machine learning to uncover patterns and forecast stock returns ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00459)). In 2021, I graduated from [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/) with a B.A. in Mathematics and B.A. in Economics (honors). I was advised by Professor [Robert Murphy](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/offices/office-of-university-communications/for-the-media/boston-college-faculty-experts/robert-murphy.html) on my senior honors thesis examining how instability in the financial market propagates into the real economy.

## Research
My research aims to build human-centered AI systems that provide reliable and personalized support for decision-making under uncertainty. To this end, I focus on three complementary research directions:
* `Interpretability`: Evaluating model behaviors and dissecting internal model architectures to advance our understanding of how models represent information and carry out reasoning.

* `Alignment`: Identifying embedded biases and failure modes and developing methods to mitigate harmful or unintended behaviors.

* `Personalization`: Developing models that surface meaningful, domain-specific insights to users while aligning model behavior with individual human preferences.
