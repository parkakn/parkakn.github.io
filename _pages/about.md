### About
Hi! Currently, I am a data scientitst at [MIT Open Learning](https://openlearning.mit.edu/), where I am working on analyzing a network-based model of occupational labor mobility with a focus on advanced manufacturing jobs. I am also working with the Personal Robots Group of MIT Media Lab on developing a educational AI tutor. 

Previously, I worked on analyzing the Bitcoin blockchain and creating a citation network of finance journal articles as a full-time research assistant for Professor Antoinette Schoar at MIT Sloan School of Management. In May 2023, I completed my M.S. in mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University. Prior to that, I graduated from Boston College in 2021 with a B.A. in mathematics and a B.A. in economics. 

Outside of work, I enjoy playing soccer! I played for Citybros FC while in New York, FC Boston during college, and currently play for MIT FC.
