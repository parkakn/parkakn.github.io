I am a software engineer at [Personal Robots group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/) of [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). My long term research endeavor is to advance aritificial integlligence (AI) that improves humans decision making under uncertainty. Currently, my research revolves around `interpretability` and `alignment` of language models (LMs) as modern AI tutors. I study how they behave pedagogically, how their behavior influences student learning, and how different alignment techniques shape those outcomes. I also develop core components of [`PyTutor`](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/pytutor-empowering-equitable-education-pathways-in-computing-with-generative-ai/overview/), an AI tutoring platform deployed across multiple universities as part of the [MIT RAISE](https://raise.mit.edu/) initiative. 
<!-- , such as advanced  retrieval for PyTutor’s retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) pipeline and personalized feedback feature based on student’s classroom performance. -->

Before MIT, I completed my Master of Science in Mathematics at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) at [New York University](https://www.cs.umd.edu) with a master's thesis on applying machine learning methods to stock return forecasting ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00459)). I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Kenneth Winston](https://math-finance.cims.nyu.edu/team/kenneth-winston/) and to receive additional mentorship from Professor [Jonathan Goodman](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/GOODMAN_Jonathan.html).

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/), where I studied a wide range of topics across mathematics, economics, and finance. My senior honors thesis examined the transfer of instability between the stock market and the real economy, focusing on how financial shocks propagate through the business cycle.
